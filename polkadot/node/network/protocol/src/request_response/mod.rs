//! Overview over request/responses as used in `Polkadot`.
//!
//! `enum Protocol` .... List of all supported protocols.
//!
//! `enum Requests`  .... List of all supported requests, each entry matches one in protocols, but
//! has the actual request as payload.
//!
//! `struct IncomingRequest` .... wrapper for incoming requests, containing a sender for sending
//! responses.
//!
//! `struct OutgoingRequest` .... wrapper for outgoing requests, containing a sender used by the
//! networking code for delivering responses/delivery errors.
//!
//! `trait IsRequest` .... A trait describing a particular request. It is used for gathering meta
//! data, like what is the corresponding response type.
//!
//!  ## Versioning
//!
//! Versioning for request-response protocols can be done in multiple ways.
//!
//! If you're just changing the protocol name but the binary payloads are the same, just add a new
//! `fallback_name` to the protocol config.
//!
//! One way in which versioning has historically been achieved for req-response protocols is to
//! bundle the new req-resp version with an upgrade of a notifications protocol. The subsystem would
//! then know which request version to use based on stored data about the peer's notifications
//! protocol version.
//!
//! When bumping a notifications protocol version is not needed/desirable, you may add a new
//! req-resp protocol and set the old request as a fallback (see
//! `OutgoingRequest::new_with_fallback`). A request with the new version will be attempted and if
//! the protocol is refused by the peer, the fallback protocol request will be used.
//! Information about the actually used protocol will be returned alongside the raw response, so
//! that you know how to decode it.
